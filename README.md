# What is this plugin about?
UltimateBlood is a highly customizable Minecraft plugin designed to intensify and enrich gameplay with unique bleeding mechanics. Players can experience progressive bleeding effects that vary in severity, introducing a layer of realism to combat. To stop the bleeding, players must use bandages, and they will receive visual feedback through a red-screen effect as a warning.

## Customization
The plugin offers a range of configuration options, allowing server owners to fine-tune how and when players bleed, ensuring compatibility with different gameplay styles.
### Commands
Some commands you can use in-game are: /ub or /ultimateblood as base command followed by:
- gui : to open a gui where you can get bandages and futures items as an administrator
- reload : to reload configuration
